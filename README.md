# Extended Conversations

Extended Conversations is a HBS' BattleTech conversation-based utility mod. It extends the conversation system to provide more actions, conditions and more.

Use [ConverseTek - Sim Conversation Editor](https://github.com/CWolfs/ConverseTek) for support with the additional functionality that this mod provides.

Some of the actions and conditions added will be usable by the events system too.

## Features

### Conditions

* `Evaluate Tag for Current System` - This allows you to check if the current star system has the tag specified.
* `Evaluate BattleTech Int` - This allows you to check against a commander, company or current system integer statistic.
* `Evaluate Funds` - This allows you to check a fund amount against the company funds.

### Actions

* `Time Skip` - This allows you to jump forward in time by the set amount. This processes the usual mechanics like healing, repairs and monthly fees.
* `Set Current System` - This allows you to set the current star system by star system id (e.g. starsystemdef_Smithon)
