# Extended Conversations

Extended Conversations is a HBS' BattleTech conversation-based utility mod. It extends the conversation system to provide more actions, conditions and more.

Use [ConverseTek - Sim Conversation Editor](https://github.com/CWolfs/ConverseTek) for support with the additional functionality that this mod provides.

Some of the actions and conditions added will be usable by the events system too.
