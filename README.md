# Extended Conversations

Extended Conversations is a HBS' BattleTech conversation-based utility mod. It extends the conversation system to provide more actions, conditions and more.

Use [ConverseTek - Sim Conversation Editor](https://github.com/CWolfs/ConverseTek) for support with the additional functionality that this mod provides.

## Installation Instructions

* Move into your ModTek `Mods` folder
* Move the `operations` folder into your `ConverseTek/defs` folder. This will enable all the conditions, actions and value getters from Extended Conversations in ConverseTek.

## Features

### Dialog Tags

Dialog tags allow you to inject data into your dialog text. 

* `<Stats.Company.[StatName]>` - This allows you to inject any company stat (e.g. `<Stats.Company.MyStatName>`)
* `<Stats.Commander.[StatName]`> - This allows you to inject any commander stat
* `<Stats.CurrentSystem.[StatName]`> - This allows you to inject any current system stat

### Conditions

* `Evaluate Tag for Current System` - This allows you to check if the current star system has the tag specified.
* `Evaluate BattleTech String` - This allows you to check against a commander, company or current system string statistic.
* `Evaluate BattleTech Int` - This allows you to check against a commander, company or current system integer statistic.
* `Evaluate BattleTech Float` - This allows you to check against a commander, company or current system float statistic.
* `Evaluate Funds` - This allows you to check a fund amount against the company funds.

### Actions

* `Time Skip` - This allows you to jump forward in time by the set amount. This processes the usual mechanics like healing, repairs and monthly fees.
* `Set Current System` - This allows you to set the current star system by star system id (e.g. starsystemdef_Smithon), with the option of using the calculated travel time or not.
* `Modify Funds` - This allows you to add, or remove, X amount of cbills from the company funds.
* `Start Conversation Custom` - This starts a group conversation for you. You specify the conversation id, header and subheader.
* `Set Characters Visible` - This allows you to show and hide characters in the dropship. You specify the characters in a comma seperated list.

### Value Getters

* `Get BattleTech String` - This can be used in the above conditions and actions. It allows you to grab a commander, company or current system string statistic for use in the other operations. An example would be storing a system id in a company stat, then using this to pull out the system id in the `Set Current System` action.
* `Get BattleTech Int` - Same as above but for the return type of 'int'
* `Get BattleTech Float` - Same as above but for the return type of 'float'
